Many thanks to Udacity's Machine Learning Course (https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) with Sabastian Thrun and Katie Malone, some small pieces of code come from this course, as well as the general approach for using Scikit-learn.  

Scikit-learn: the best ML library in the world, in my humble opinion: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/
